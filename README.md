# cpp-projects
My portfolio of c++ projects. Some big, some small.
Descriptions of folders and contains:
1)"Small Projects" folder: Contains very small cpp projects. On average 30-100 lines. Code inside these projects directly correlates with their names. These projects were my learning stones.
2)"Big Projects" folder: Contains large and meaningful projects. One of the projects is BullCowGame. A game made in c++ console where you can choose the length of the word and after that you have to guess a word that a code has chosen, guided by bulls (right letters in the right place) or cows (right letter but in the wrong place). All of the words are acronyms (Meaning that all letters in those words are unique).
